🚗 Driver Multiple Fake Account Detection Using Deep Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting and preventing multiple fake driver accounts during the user registration process using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. The system enhances platform security by validating user identities through Aadhaar-linked mobile numbers and email verification, helping reduce fraud and improve user authenticity.

🎯 Problem Statement

Online platforms face a growing challenge of users creating multiple fake accounts, leading to fraud, misuse of services, and data integrity issues. Traditional rule-based systems often fail to detect sophisticated fake registrations.

💡 Solution

A data-driven fraud detection system that:

Verifies identity using Aadhaar-linked credentials

Detects duplicate or suspicious registrations

Uses supervised machine learning models to identify inconsistencies in user data

🛠 Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Database: SQL

Libraries & Tools:

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Machine Learning: Supervised Learning Algorithms

Deep Learning: Neural Network–based detection models

⚙️ System Workflow

User submits registration details

Aadhaar-linked mobile number & email verification

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Feature extraction from user identity data

ML/DL model predicts legitimacy of the account
